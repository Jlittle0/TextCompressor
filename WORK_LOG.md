Like a tst binary tree. |
| Dec 3   | 1:50-3:00pm |                                                          Spent this time working on creating a method that would allow me to convert every character in a given string into 5 bits and then have an escape character that makes whether something should be uppercase or lowercase. In the TestingArea, this function/idea seems to be working perfectly and can handle everything at the moment except spaces. It's able to compress the code into 5 bit binary segments and then also re-expand it into the original text! Actual compressor file still empty but I think this is decent progress and already gives like a 80% compression ratio since most of the texts are letters in the standard english alphabet. |
| Dec 5   | 10-10:45am  | Worked on implemeneting a hashmap into this project so that I could easily add and track the occurence of given strings that I have/want to check for. By doing this, I can keep track of the value and do fast look ups so that for longer chunks of text that I'm trying to see the frequency of words for, it's not overly slow. Additionally, I was thinking of then having an arraylist/new hashmap that was an ordered list of keys and values that had no empty space and took the (set number) of top values from the overall hashmap that was tracking each word's frequency. Using this, I can grab the most used words/phrases and convert them into special characters that reduce their size significantly. |

Biggest problem at the moment is just exporting the arraylist that I made without any of the null elements and sorting it. The sorting part is very difficult due to my lack of familiarity in Comparators so I've just been testing different methods and can't seem to get it yet :( |
